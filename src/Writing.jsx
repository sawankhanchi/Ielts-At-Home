          <p>
            The IELTS Academic Writing test is made up of two tasks, Writing Task 1 and Writing Task 2. 
            The questions in the Academic Writing test are different to those in the General Training Writing test.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />

          <b>Task 1</b>
          <br />
          <p> In Academic Writing Task 1, you will be shown a visual representation of information; 
            a graph, table, chart or diagram, and you are asked to summarise, describe or explain the information you see. 
            Make sure you organise your response into three main parts, the introduction, an overview and the main features supported by figures from the diagram.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Task 2</b>
          <br />
          <p>  In Academic Writing Task 2, you will be presented with a point of view, argument, or problem. 
            The topics can range from the environment to immigration, culture, and even technology. 
            You might be asked to, agree or disagree with a point of view or argument, discuss two 
            opposing views, write about the advantages or disadvantages of a topic, or explain a given 
            problem, or the cause of a problem and offer a solution. Your response for Academic Writing Task 2 will 
            need to be in an essay format.
          </p>

          <h2><b>Note</b></h2>

          <p>I suggest IELTS students to use that book in order to get higher band score as it provides both 
              Task 1 and Task 2. An important thing is that by using this book students can get higher band score in writing
              module because it is easy to understand contents which is included in that book. So, purchase
              this IELTS Writing Book by Parthesh Thakkar online on Amazon or Flipkart if you wanna get desired band score.

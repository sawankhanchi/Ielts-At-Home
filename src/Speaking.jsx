          <h2>A quick look at IELTS Speaking test</h2>

          <b>Duration: 11 to 14 minutes</b>
          <br />
        
          <p>
            The Speaking test will assess your use of spoken English. The test will last 
            between 11 and 14 minutes where you will discuss a variety of topics with an IELTS examiner.
            Your test will take place in a quiet room with an examiner who will encourage you to 
            keep speaking. Unlike an AI test, an IELTS examiner will be able to make you feel relaxed 
            and confident. Theyâ€™re also able to understand your accent to ensure you get the 
            best possible score. There are 3 parts to the Speaking test.</p>

          <br />

          <h2><b>Part 1</b></h2>
          <p>
            The examiner will ask you general questions about yourself and a range of familiar topics, 
            such as home, family, work, studies and interests. This part lasts between 4 and 5 minutes.
          </p>

          <h2><b>Part 2</b></h2>
          <p>
            You will be given a task card and the examiner will ask you to talk about a topic. 
            You will have 1 minute to prepare before speaking for up to 2 minutes. 
            The examiner will then ask one or two questions on the same topic to finish this part of the test. 
          </p>

          <h2><b>Part 3</b></h2>
          <p>
            You will be asked further questions connected to the topic in Part 2. These questions will 
            allow you to discuss more abstract ideas and issues. This part of the test lasts between 
            4 and 5 minutes. 
          </p>
          


          <h2><b>Tips to improve speaking </b></h2>

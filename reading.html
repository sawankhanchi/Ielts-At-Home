            The IELTS Academic Reading test assesses a wide range of reading skills including your ability to 
            follow an argument, recognise a writer’s opinion, attitude or purpose. It looks at how well 
            you can read to understand main ideas, details, opinions and implied meanings. Your reading 
            comprehension skills are tested, covering skimming, scanning and reading for detail.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Academic Reading test is made up of 3 long texts which are taken from current books, 
            journals, magazines and newspapers. The texts are related to topics you might face if you 
            were to study at an undergraduate or postgraduate level or apply for professional registration 
            in an English-speaking environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            You will have to answer 40 questions in the Academic Reading test. These questions can range 
            from multiple choice to identifying information or a writer’s view, matching headings, features 
            and sentence endings, as well as sentence, summary, note, table and flow-chart completions, and 
            short-answer questions.

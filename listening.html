            The IELTS Academic Listening test consists of 4 parts and takes 30 minutes. It assesses your ability 
            to understand main ideas, detailed information, opinions, purpose and attitudes of the speakers, 
            as well as your ability to follow the development of ideas.
            <br>
            <br>
            You will listen to 4 recordings in your Academic Listening test and need to answer 40 questions 
            based on these recordings. The first two recordings deal with situations you might experience 
            in an everyday context. The last two recordings, however, focus on situations that might occur 
            in an education or training context.

            <br>
            In recordings 1 and 3 you will hear a conversation between two or more speakers, however in 
            recordings 2 and 4 will hear a monologue. You will need to answer questions connected to the 
            recordings ranging from multiple choice to matching information, headings, features and 
            sentence endings, as well as sentence, summary, note, table, diagram or flow-chart completion.
